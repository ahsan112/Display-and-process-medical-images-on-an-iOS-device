# Display and process medical images on an iOS device

### Objective:
> The project set out with two main goals:
•	To develop an algorithm that was able to decode and display all modalities of medical images (DICOM Standard).
•	To explore image processing techniques that can be modified and applied to medical images on a mobile device.


#### Requirements:  

The project had the following requirements: 

    •	The application must be able to decode and display medical images (such as CT, MRI, X ray, Ultra sound) of the DICOM standard.
    •	The application should have the ability to perform an image processing technique 
    •	The application should be able to download and display medical images
    •	The application should have some type of in app security such as passcode or fingerprint recognition 
    •	The application should be able to share downloaded files through email.
    
    
#### Outcomes: 

    •	Successfully implemented all required features mentioned above and the following bellow.
    •	Ability to view a study in different views such as 2,3,4 images at a time
    •	Ability to view two different studies side by side
    •	Touch ID and Passcode authentication 
    •	Ability to share whole study or individual studies.
    •	Search feature to query studies based on patient ID or image type.
    •	Image manipulation techniques:
        o	Zoom, pan, draw line to measure 
    •	Image processing capable of changing pixel values to display hidden features of an medical image (e.g view tissue of a 
        patients kidney or bone by manipulating the pixel values.
    •	Downloading of a data set as zip file or singular Dicom file
